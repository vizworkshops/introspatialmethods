GIS poses some unique problems. Two things to think about when mapping and looking at maps are:

* Projections
* Modifiable areal unit problem or MAUP

A map projection is simply a process that makes the round earth flat in order to display it on a piece of paper or your computer/table/phone/etc. screen. One of the most important things to consider about map projections are relative size of countries and places and what that means when thinking about all types of issues.

How can distortion of places have an impact on an issue?



MAUP is another important challenge to consider when mapping. It is especially important when you begin mapping and have data that is represented within boundaries such as neigbhorhoods, zip codes, or any other type of defined area. Zip codes are a notorious mapping problem as oftentimes it is easy to map a certain variable using a zip code boundary.

Discussion point:

Why might a zip code be a problem for learning about a place?
