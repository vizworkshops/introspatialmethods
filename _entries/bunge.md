Another powerful thought that I have found that is not as commonly known or cited comes from a book entitled, "Fitzgerald Geography of a Revolution," by William Bunge. Published in 1971 this book is a study about a single neigbhorhood through interviews, archival materials, maps, and the intensive study of place and space. One of the most impactful parts of the book that I have found applicable to GIS and spatial thinking is this thought:  


*"impossible to understand the neighborhood without being a neighbor"*

**Map showing data of where children have died by automobiles** | **Same data, different map and title**

Discussion:

As you work on creating a map what are the challenges for thinking through your relationship with the place that you are trying to discuss or represent?

Is it always possible to be a neighbor?
