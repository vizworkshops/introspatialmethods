Welcome to this very introductory workshop to spatial methods and thinking. The materials found here are a companion to an in-person workshop that I offer to students and faculty at the University of Southern California

The aim of this workshop is to give an overview of GIS, mapping, and spatial methods to anyone interested in trying to incorporate these into their own research. Mapping and GIS have become increasingly popular ways of engaging research and answering/posing questions. Almost any discipline and research problem can benefit from thinking about the importance of place and space. 

After this workshop participants should feel confident to start exploring how GIS, mapping, and spatial thinking might become an integral part of their research process.
