Spatial joining is the process of joining two different spatial datasets by one common field. For example, you may have a set of boundaries, for example neighborhood boundaries, and a second set of data that you collected about the neighborhood. In order to visualize that data you will need to join it to the boundary file. 

A common useage of spatial joining is downloading census data and then joining to the corresponding geographic boundary - census tract, county, state, etc.
