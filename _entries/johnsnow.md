One of the best examples of spatial thinking was John Snow's cholera map from 1854. Why is this example important? Because it demonstrates how a map can help to reveal patterns that ultimately help to change how you think about an issue or problem. The John Snow example is very concrete and real-world problem but it also shows the importance of how data is gathered and how important that process is when attempting to answer questions.

Discussion:

The context is a cholera outbreak in London in 1854. At the time the prevailing thought was that cholera was spread through the air. John Snow had a different theory.
