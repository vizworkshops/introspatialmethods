title: GIS + Spatial Thinking
---

GIS and spatial thinking involve two different sets of practices that have overlapping methods, themes, and materials.

GIS or Geographic Information System is a system that lets you use spatial or geographic data to perform any number of functions, from filtering data, to creating data, to analyzing or modeling data. At its most fundamental level a GIS is a set of tools or software that allows you to work with geospatial data. One of the most useful things that you can do with a GIS is layer multiple datasets in order to more easily see relationships between them. Another thing that a GIS allows you to do is to analyze and model data. For example, calculating the quickest routes to hospitals or schools during an emergency or creating an environmental index rating for a neighborhood using multiple variables. A GIS can be used to simply show points on a map or as complex as predicting the spread of a virus.   

Spatial thinking on the other hand does not require a GIS. Spatial thinking is an approach that frames a research question or problem by understanding how place/space can have an impact on that question/problem. A GIS can help to start one thinking about a problem spatially or it can help to answer questions posed by spatial thinking. In many cases approaching a problem spatially need not result in the creation of a map. Tables, figures, and other types of visualization can show data and its relationship to a place. One thing to always be asking yourself is, "do I need to make a map in order to understand this problem or question better?" 

If you do need to make a map then critically approaching the mapmaking process is essential. Digital and analog mapmaking have critical approaches that emphasize ethical practices when working with data and representing place and space.

Discussion: How have you already used spatial thinking in your own research? Have you used any GIS technologies or tools? How have you used them?
