title: GIS + Spatial Thinking
---

GIS and spatial thinking involve two different sets of practices that have overlapping methods, themes, and materials.

GIS or Geographic Information System is a system that lets you use spatial or geographic data to perform any number of functions, from filtering data, to creating data, to analyzing or modeling data. At its most fundamental level a GIS is a set of tools or software that allows you to work with geospatial data. 

Spatial thinking on the other hand does not require a GIS. Spatial thinking is an approach that frames a research question or problem by understanding how place/space can have an impact on that question/problem. A GIS can help to start one thinking about a problem spatially or it can help to answer questions posed by spatial thinking.
