Another aspect of working with GIS data (and really any kind of data) is proper documentation. This can be as simple as naming files consistenly and as complex as creating thorough documenation for any and all changes that you make to a data file. When using GIS software this quickly becomes an issue as you almost never put into a GIS the same file that you initially downloaded. Data preperation is often the hardest part of working with geospatial data and making sure that you know how you prepared file is not only important for you but for the next person using your data.  

The simplest way to get into this habit is by creating folders for data that contain a readme text file that describes your data file. The description should be as complete as possible and should attempt to document file name changes, the changes that you made, how you made them, and WHY you made them. One aspect that is often left out of descriptive files is why choices were made to do one thing one way and another another way. Providing the reasons why you did something is essential for others to understand how you worked with and prepared your data.
