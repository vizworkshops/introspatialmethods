You will download and explore two sets of data:  

The first is about historical Los Angeles during the 1930s and 1940s. It includes a georeferenced redlining map, an accompanying polygon file of the redlining map, locations from the 1937 Green Book and 1947 Greenbook, and contemporary Los Angeles Neighborhood polygon boundaries from the Los Angeles Times.  

The second set is contemporary demographic data for Los Angeles. It includes [census tracts for Los Angeles created by LA County](https://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2011/07/19/census-tracts-2010/), 2015 American Community Survey data for Hispanics or Latinos living in Los Angeles downloaded from [Social Explorer](https://libraries.usc.edu/databases/social-explorer), and a point layer data from the Pacific Standard Time exhibit from 2017-2018 that was handcoded from the exhibit and website at the time.
