There are lots of ways of getting started with approaching your research through spatial methods. Here are some basic things to consider as you begin:

Can you describe the issue/question/problem within a spatial context? Talk about why place is important and describe how it impacts your thinking about that issue/question/problem. 

What is the geographic area/site/neighborhood that you are studying? Is it well defined? Are the borders fixed, changing, disputed? Who established the border? What historical maps or information can you gather that helps you understand the history of that place? 

What types of data would be helpful in answering your question? Does it exist? Where is it? Who created it? 

Once you have some data can you describe how it was gathered? How often it is/was gathered. Time period and frequency. Any limitations? Is it open data or restricted? How will you ensure privacy concerns if they are applicable?

What tools or software will you use? 

How will you share your work? Who will you share it with?
