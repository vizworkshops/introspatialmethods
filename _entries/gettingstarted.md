There are lots of ways of getting started with approaching your research through spatial methods. Here are some basic things to consider as you begin:

What is the geographic area that you are studying?

What type of data would you like to look at and use? 
  Where is it?
  Who created it?
  Frequency?
  Date?

Why does it matter to you and your research?

Are you intereseted in looking at static data layers or are you interested in developing an analysis?
