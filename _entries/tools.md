There is an incredibly rich set of tools and software for creating maps, analyzing and working with geospatial data, and generally visualizing data in and through maps. It is so easy in fact that it is often not a part of the research process to critique and learn more about these tools and their potential impact on your research and findings.  

One work that explores this issue is Professor Safiya Noble’s article about GIS and the commercialization of public information.  

The main observation of this article points to how GIS technologies and by extension the data associated with them are both a resource and a commodity. The article outlines how these technologies and data are consolidated by a handful of companies who are able to profit from buying and selling software and data. 
She goes on to argue that the public, you and I, are contributing to this data by using some of this software - which is free or nearly free while you are at the university etc. 

The article was written in 2011 and since that time, ESRI arguably the largest GIS software provider in the world, has made a remarkable push into the world of free software through their ArcGIS Online and StoryMap platforms. At the same time the article didn’t even mention some of the most important GIS tools available for researchers now, CARTO, MapBox, and other tools like Omeka, Neatline, etc.  

The observations from this work are powerful:  

Why do we use these tools?
How do we use them. 
What happens with the data that we use or create?
