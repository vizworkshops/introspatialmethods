One geographic principle to consider is Tobler's first law of geography:  


"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"  

This law has technical ramifications on some GIS analysis, like spatial correlation. But it also has important implications for just thinking about how you understand and how you might ask questions about place and space. One of the background concepts of which the theory is based the idea of **friction of distance** which simply put is that if you the same good, for example a sandwich, is at a store closer to you then you would get it at that store because all things being equal you wouldn't want to expend the extra energy and cost of traveling to a store further away.
