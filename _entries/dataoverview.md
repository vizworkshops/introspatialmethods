Data is critical to GIS and mapping. There is an incredily rich and diverse world of geospatial data.

Geospatial data is broken up primarily into two worlds:

- Raster
- Vector

Raster data is basically an image file which contains pixels that displays your data. Raster data can be satellite imagery, it can be a digital elevation models (DEM), or an image file like a TIFF. Raster data lends itself well to representing the physical world.

Vector data uses geometry to create points, lines, and polygons. 



In addition to these, the most common additional data that is used in GIS is tabular data, such as a CSV or excel spreadsheet. Tabular data can have any number of variables which can be joined to
